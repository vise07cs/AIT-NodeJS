<!-- CAllbacks in JS -->

Functionwhich is passed as an arguement to another function is called a callback function.

The arguemented function which is passed to another function is known as callback fuction .

function f1(function(){
  <!-- some logic -->
})


Functions which take another function as an arguement is called Higher Order Function 
Here f1 is known as higher oreder function .  


we will be using callback functions heavily .
Also we will use module pattern (CommonJS module pattern)---------> we use module.exports (to export ) and require (to import)


**(module is a global object in JS )

export is a property inside module object


From tomorrow we will be starting with NodeJS
